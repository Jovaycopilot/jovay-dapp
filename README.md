# Jovay DApp Ecosystem Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Jovay DApp Ecosystem! This repository is the central hub for the submission, review, and showcase of DApps on the Jovay network.

Our mission is to foster a vibrant, high-quality, and secure ecosystem of decentralized applications. If you've deployed a DApp on Jovay, we cordially invite you to submit it for listing on our official ecosystem page to gain greater visibility and reach a wider audience.

In the future, this repository will host the open-source code for the [Ecosystem page](https://jovay.io/ecosystem) on our official website, enabling a community-driven approach to showcasing projects.
