### Short Description:
FluxA is building Extensible Payment Primitives for the era of AI. FluxA is the payment base layer for the AI economyâ€”built for humans and agents. We turn API calls and data access into commerce with six primitives: Quote, Permit, Route, Pay, Settle, Receipt. Dual-rail acceptance (stablecoins + cards), streaming micropayments, and verifiable receipts make x402/AP2/ACP ready in minutes.
