# How to Contribute

We're excited that you want to add your DApp to the Jovay ecosystem! To ensure a smooth process, please follow these guidelines.

## Submission Process

We use GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) to manage all DApp submissions. This is the primary and preferred method.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Create a New DApp File

1.  Navigate to the `dapps/` directory.
2.  Create a copy of the `_template.json` file.
3.  Rename the new file to `your-dapp-name.json`. Please use a unique, lowercase name with hyphens for spaces.
4.  Fill out the details in your new JSON file with your DApp's information.

### Step 3: Submit a Pull Request

1.  Commit the new JSON file to your forked repository.
2.  Create a new Pull Request from your fork to the `main` branch of this repository.
3.  The PR description will be pre-filled with a template. Please fill it out completely.

## Review Process

1.  **Automated Checks:** Once you submit your PR, a GitHub Action will automatically check for basic formatting and required fields.
2.  **Team Review:** Our team will review your submission for accuracy and functionality.
3.  **Approval & Merge:** If everything looks good, we will approve and merge your PR. Your DApp will then be automatically added to the Jovay website.
